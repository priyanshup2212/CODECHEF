Chef started watching a movie that runs for a total of XX minutes.

Chef has decided to watch the first YY minutes of the movie at twice the usual speed as he was warned by his friends that the movie gets interesting only after the first YY minutes.

How long will Chef spend watching the movie in total?

Note: It is guaranteed that YY is even.

Input Format
The first line contains two space separated integers X, YX,Y - as per the problem statement.
Output Format
Print in a single line, an integer denoting the total number of minutes that Chef spends in watching the movie.
Constraints
1 \leq X, Y \leq 10001≤X,Y≤1000
YY is an even integer.
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Sample 1:
Input
Output
100 20
90
Explanation:
For the first Y = 20Y=20 minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is \frac{Y}{2} = 10

Y
​
 =10 minutes.

For the remaining X - Y = 80X−Y=80 minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 8080 minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.

In total, Chef spends 10 + 80 = 9010+80=90 minutes watching the entire movie.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
50 24
38
Explanation:
For the first Y = 24Y=24 minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is \frac{Y}{2} = 12

Y
​
 =12 minutes.

For the remaining X - Y = 26X−Y=26 minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 2626 minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.

In total, Chef spends 12 + 26 = 3812+26=38 minutes watching the entire movie.
