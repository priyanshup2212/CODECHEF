You are given the distances for all 33 throws of a player. Determine the final score of the player.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, three integers A, B,A,B, and CC denoting the distances in each throw.
Output Format
For each test case, output the final score of the player.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100

Explanation:
Test Case 11: The longest distance is achieved in the second throw, which is equal to 1515 units. Thus, the answer is 1515.

Test Case 22: In all throws, the distance is 3232 units. Thus, the final score is 3232.
