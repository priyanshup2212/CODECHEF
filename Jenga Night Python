Problem
Chef hosts a party for his birthday. There are NN people at the party. All these NN people decide to play Jenga.

There are XX Jenga tiles available. In one round, all the players pick 11 tile each and place it in the tower.
The game is valid if:

All the players have a tile in each round;
All the tiles are used at the end.
Given NN and XX, find whether the game is valid.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers NN and XX representing the number of people at the party and the number of available tiles respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line \texttt{YES}YES if the game is valid, else output \texttt{NO}NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \texttt{YeS}YeS, \texttt{yEs}yEs, \texttt{yes}yes and \texttt{YES}YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case 11: The game will last for 11 round after which the tiles will finish.
